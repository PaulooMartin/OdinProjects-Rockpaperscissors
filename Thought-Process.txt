Step 1, Understand.

The goal: Make a game of Rock paper scissors
Where: Just on the console
Players: User and computer

1. Make a game of rock paper scissors (RPS).
2. The game will have the computer and the user as players.
3. The game will have x number of rounds.
4. Each player will give their choice,
   For the computer: randomly chosen
   For the user: by asking them.
5. After each choice has been taken, compare their choices and determine the winner
6. Show who is the winner of the round
   Or if tied, show tie.
   Add a score of +1 to the winner, and no score if tied or loser.
7. Repeat until all the rounds finish.
8. After all rounds has finished, determine the champion.
9. Show who is the champion. If no champion, say "Nobody won this game!".

Odin Rules:

1. Make a function named: getComputerChoice, that will randomly return the choice for the computer.
2. Make a function that can play a single round of RPS and will take in two parameters, namely:
a. playerSelection and,
b. computerSelection
which then returns a string declaring the winner of the round, like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
<!-- Make sure that the player's selection is case-insensitive -->

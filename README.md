## [About the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)
> The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. It is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with the team. Many find success from Odin Project's curriculum because of its hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date.

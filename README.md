# odin_rockpaperscissors

Hello!

This is my repository for the project: Rock Paper Scissors, of The Odin Project.

This project is about making a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors on the browser's console. The game consists of 5 rounds. Each round a winner is determined and after all rounds, the champion will then be decided.

Try it for yourself and see if humanity is still on top or if AI has taken over.

Follow along with me [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)!

## [About the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)

> The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. It is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with the team. Many find success from Odin Project's curriculum because of its hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date.
